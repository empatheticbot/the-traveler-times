## Getting Started

`npm run bootstrap`

`npx wrangler login`

`npm run start` will start all of the workers locally.

`npm run start:web` will then build the website from the local workers. Note that the workers need to be started first.

Alternatively, you can have the website use the production code by running the command `npm run start:web:prod`
