## Hello fellow guardian! üëã

Thanks for stopping by and giving The Traveler Times a once over‚ÄìI hope you find it helpful in your adventures.

The Traveler Times started out as a little hobby project for myself and quickly evolved into something I felt others might get some use out of. It originally came about out of the desire to have a single page that gave me some quick insights into what was happening in Destiny _now_.

It isn't meant to replace the fantastic and far more robust [Braytech](bray.tech), [DIM](https://destinyitemmanager.com), [Destiny Tracker](https://destinytracker.com), [Today in Destiny](https://www.todayindestiny.com), or any of the other various reports and stats apps. It's meant to be a fun, stylized way to get a snapshot of what is happening in the world of Destiny with no fuss‚Äìno login or hassles‚Äìjust some quickly digestable information.

If you find this site useful and would like to see it continue to be supported and improve over time please consider tossing some glimmer my way. It really does make a difference and is much appreciated!
