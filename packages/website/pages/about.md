Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by and giving The Traveler Times a once overâ€“I hope you find it helpful in your adventures as a guardian.

This site was built and is maintained by [Steve Ledsworth](https://twitter.com/sledsworth). It's a hobby passion project that ended up getting good enough that I felt comfortable to share it with the world at large. I mention this only to convince you I deserve your empathy in our interactionsâ€“know that we share in the desire for the site to become better over time, but I am just one person working on this project in spare time.

The Traveler Times isn't meant to replace the fantastic [Braytech](bray.tech), [DIM](https://destinyitemmanager.com), [Destiny Tracker](https://destinytracker.com), [Today in Destiny](https://www.todayindestiny.com), or any of the other various reports and stats apps. It's meant to be a fun, stylized way to get a snapshot of what is happening in the world of Destiny _now_. No login or hasslesâ€“just information about the game on a general level.
