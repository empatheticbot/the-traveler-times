## Hello there guardian! üëã

Thanks for stopping by and giving The Traveler Times a once over‚ÄìI hope you find it helpful in your adventures.

This site was built and is maintained by [Steve Ledsworth](https://twitter.com/sledsworth). He builds software (mostly web-based) under his company [Empahteticbot](https://twitter.com/empathetic_bot).

This site in-particular started out as a little hobby project for myself and quickly evolved into something I felt others might get some use out of. It originally came about out of the desire to have a single page that gave me some quick insights into what was happening in Destiny _now_. It isn't meant to replace the fantastic and far more robust [Braytech](bray.tech), [DIM](https://destinyitemmanager.com), [Destiny Tracker](https://destinytracker.com), [Today in Destiny](https://www.todayindestiny.com), or any of the other various reports and stats apps. It's meant to be a fun, stylized way to get a snapshot of what is happening in the world of Destiny with no fuss. No login or hassles‚Äìjust some quickly digestable information.

If you have an idea or find a bug on the site, feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:support@thetraveler.news">support@thetraveler.news</a>.

If you find this site useful and would like to see it continue to be supported and improve over time please consider tossing some glimmer my way. It really does make a difference and is much appreciated!
