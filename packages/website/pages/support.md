## Get in Touch

I think it's really great that you care about the site enough to take some time to report a bug or explain your thoughtful feature idea! With this in mind I'll do my very best to respond, but I do ask that you keep in mind that this is a fun side-gig for me and doesn't pay the bills.

There are a couple options to get in touch:

- **If you have a Github account** go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/empatheticbot/the-traveler-times/issues)
- **If you are on Twitter** shoot me a message [@traveler_times](https://twitter.com/traveler_times)
- Otherwise, send me an email at <a href="mailto:support@thetraveler.news">support@thetraveler.news</a>

I look forward to hearing from you!
